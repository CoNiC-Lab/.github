## About Us

The Computational Neuroscience & Neural Computation (CoNiC) Lab is a scientific community dedicated to understanding how the brain computes the mind. We develop theoretical frameworks and computational models to investigate the biophysical bases of cognition and behavior.

Our research spans multiple levels of analysis ‚Äì from individual neurons and synapses to networks and systems ‚Äì with a particular focus on:

- Biophysically detailed neural simulations
- Cognitive modeling and neural information processing
- Neural dynamics in learning and memory
- Analysis methods for neural and behavioral data
- Computational principles underlying brain function

## Our Projects

### CoNiC Ecosystem

The CoNiC ecosystem is a set of interconnected, yet independent software tools designed to facilitate computational neuroscience research:

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [neurolytics](https://github.com/conic-lab/neurolytics) | Advanced neural data analysis, metrics, and visualization |
| [conic-core](https://github.com/conic-lab/conic-core) | Core utilities and shared components for the CoNiC ecosystem |
| [conic-models](https://github.com/conic-lab/conic-models) | Neural network models with varying levels of biophysical detail |
| [conic-simulator](https://github.com/conic-lab/conic-simulator) | Simulation engines for neural models |
| [conic-optimizer](https://github.com/conic-lab/conic-optimizer) | Parameter optimization and model tuning |
| [conic-viz](https://github.com/conic-lab/conic-viz) | Advanced visualization for neural models and data |
| [conic-io](https://github.com/conic-lab/conic-io) | Input/output operations for neural data |
| [conic-deploy](https://github.com/conic-lab/conic-deploy) | Deployment tools for simulations |
| [conic](https://github.com/conic-lab/conic) | Meta-package integrating all CoNiC components |

### Standalone Tools

While the tools above can be used together as part of the CoNiC ecosystem, several are designed to function as fully independent, standalone packages:

- **[neurolytics](https://github.com/conic-lab/neurolytics)**: A comprehensive toolkit for neural data analysis that can be used with any neural data source

## Getting Started

### Installation

Most packages can be installed directly via pip:

```bash
# Install individual packages
pip install neurolytics

# Or install the complete CoNiC ecosystem
pip install conic
```

### Documentation

Each repository contains its own detailed documentation. For the CoNiC ecosystem as a whole, visit our [central documentation](https://conic-lab.github.io/conic-docs/).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

See the CONTRIBUTING.md file in each repository for specific guidelines.

## Publications

Our software tools are developed alongside and support our research. Some key publications include:

If you use our software in your research, please cite the appropriate packages as detailed in each repository's README.

## Team

Our lab consists of researchers, developers, and collaborators from around the world. At the moment, it is mainly a one-man band, relying only on the PI and international collaborators.
